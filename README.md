# 1MillionDevs Pepo Community Portal

## Overview

The Community Portal is an experiment to test short-form video updates in the Ethereum community.

The Pepo Community Portal is a playground for the 1MD video community. Pepo focuses on 30 second videos. Videos can be easily replied to and be tipped. The tip is transered as a Pepo token. The Pepo token runs on an OST sidechain.

### Hypothesis

Short form video will enable more active conversations and engagements in the Ethereum community. Micro-tipping will enhance the relationships between creators and audience.

**Steps To Validate**

1. Grow Pepo Community to 500 Active Users
2. Weekly Bounties & Micro-Tasks
3. Highlight New Projects

### Background

**The 1MD & Pepo Leaderboard was an experiment started at EthDenver.** The original assumption was a video leaderboard would help us incentivize specific event actions.

#### Results

The audience we reached is 70+ members and 50+ videos in the first week.

During the original event (EthDenver) our focus was curating "aha moments" and "big ideas" from the attendees. Videos posted contained a mixture of tags: #1MillionDevs #1MD #idea #aha, etc...
